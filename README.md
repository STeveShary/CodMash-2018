## Devops Zen: Injecting Automated Tests into Infrastructure

Deployments to production can be a point of fear and tension. We cover strategies that used at Kroger to move new features and fixes to the customer quickly and safely. Industry techniques increased production releases from once a quarter in the middle of the night to dozens of daytime production releases every day. We cover our use trunk based development, dark environments, blue-green deployments, hot toggles, and QA in production to reduce risk. We show how advanced metrics and multi-variate testing strategies can advance you to understand the true value of production changes to customers.
